    # )

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple module which tries to split any SQL code, even including
non-standard extensions (for the details see the L</SUPPORTED DBMSs> section
below), into the atomic statements it is composed of.

The logic used to split the SQL code is more sophisticated than a raw C<split>
on the C<;> (semicolon) character: first, various different statement terminator
I<tokens> are recognized (see below for the list), then this module is able to
correctly handle the presence of said tokens inside identifiers, values,
comments, C<BEGIN ... END> blocks (even nested), I<dollar-quoted> strings, MySQL
custom C<DELIMITER>s, procedural code etc., as (partially) exemplified in the
L</SYNOPSIS> above.

Consider however that this is by no means a validating parser (technically
speaking, it's just a I<context-sensitive tokenizer>). It should rather be seen
as an in-progress I<heuristic> approach, which will gradually improve as test
cases will be reported. This also means that, except for the L</LIMITATIONS>
detailed below, there is no known (to the author) SQL code the most current
release of this module can't correctly split.

The test suite bundled with the distribution (which now includes the popular
I<Sakila> and I<Pagila> sample db schemata, as detailed in the L</SHOWCASE>
section below) should give you an idea of the capabilities of this module

If your atomic statements are to be fed to a DBMS, you are encouraged to use
L<DBIx::MultiStatementDo> instead, which uses this module and also (optionally)
offers automatic transactions support, so that you'll have the I<all-or-nothing>
behavior you would probably want.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

=over 4

=item * C<< SQL::SplitStatement->new( %options ) >>

=item * C<< SQL::SplitStatement->new( \%options ) >>

=back

It creates and returns a new SQL::SplitStatement object. It accepts its options
either as a hash or a hashref.

C<new> takes the following Boolean options, which for documentation purposes can
be grouped in two sets: L</Formatting Options> and L</DBMSs Specific Options>.

=head3 Formatting Options

=over 4

=item * C<keep_terminators>

A Boolean option which causes, when set to a false value (which is the default),
the trailing terminator token to be discarded in the returned atomic statements.
When set to a true value, the terminators are kept instead.

The possible terminators (which are treated as such depending on the context)
are:

=over 4

=item *

C<;> (the I<semicolon> character);

=item *

any string defined by the MySQL C<DELIMITER> command;

=item *

an C<;> followed by an C</> (I<forward-slash> character) on its own line;

=item *

an C<;> followed by an C<.> (I<dot> character) on its own line,
followed by an C</> on its own line;

=item *

an C</> on its own line regardless of the preceding characters
(only if the C<slash_terminates> option, explained below, is set).

=back

The multi-line terminators above are always treated as a single token, that is
they are discarded (or returned) as a whole (regardless of the
C<slash_terminates> option value).

If your statements are to be fed to a DBMS, you are advised to keep this option
to its default (false) value, since some drivers/DBMSs don't want the terminator
to be present at the end of the (single) statement.

(Note that the last, possibly empty, statement of a given SQL text, never has a
trailing terminator. See below for an example.)

=item * C<keep_terminator>

An alias for the the C<keep_terminators> option explained above.
Note that if C<keep_terminators> and C<keep_terminator> are both set at object
construction time, C<new> throws an exception.

=item * C<keep_extra_spaces>

A Boolean option which causes, when set to a false value (which is the default),
the spaces (C<\s>) around the statements to be trimmed.
When set to a true value, these spaces are kept instead.

When C<keep_terminators> is set to false as well, the terminator is discarded
first (regardless of the spaces around it) and the trailing spaces are trimmed
then. This ensures that if C<keep_extra_spaces> is set to false, the returned
statements will never have trailing (nor leading) spaces, regardless of the
C<keep_terminators> value.

=item * C<keep_comments>

A Boolean option which causes, when set to a false value (which is the default),
the comments to be discarded in the returned statements. When set to a true
value, they are kept with the statements instead.

Both SQL and multi-line C-style comments are recognized.

When kept, each comment is returned in the same string with the atomic statement
it belongs to. A comment belongs to a statement if it appears, in the original
SQL code, before the end of that statement and after the terminator of the
previous statement (if it exists), as shown in this pseudo-SQL snippet:

    /* This comment
    will be returned
    together with statement1 */
    
    <statement1>; -- This will go with statement2
                  -- (note the semicolon which closes statement1)
    
    <statement2>
    -- This with statement2 as well

=item * C<keep_empty_statements>

A Boolean option which causes, when set to a false value (which is the default),
the empty statements to be discarded. When set to a true value, the empty
statements are returned instead.

A statement is considered empty when it contains no characters other than the
terminator and space characters (C<\s>).

A statement composed solely of comments is not recognized as empty and may
therefore be returned even when C<keep_empty_statements> is false. To avoid
this, it is sufficient to leave C<keep_comments> to false as well.

Note instead that an empty statement is recognized as such regardless of the
value of the options C<keep_terminators> and C<keep_extra_spaces>.

=back

These options are basically to be kept to their default (false) values,
especially if the atomic statements are to be given to a DBMS.

They are intended mainly for I<cosmetic> reasons, or if you want to count by how
many atomic statements, including the empty ones, your original SQL code was
composed of.

Another situation where they are useful (in the general case necessary, really),
is when you want to retain the ability to verbatim rebuild the original SQL
string from the returned statements:

    my $verbatim_splitter = SQL::SplitStatement->new(
        keep_terminators      => 1,
        keep_extra_spaces     => 1,
        keep_comments         => 1,
        keep_empty_statements => 1
    );
    
    my @verbatim_statements = $verbatim_splitter->split($sql_string);
    
    $sql_string eq join '', @verbatim_statements; # Always true, given the constructor above.

Other than this, again, you are recommended to stick with the defaults.

=head3 DBMSs Specific Options

The same syntactic structure can have different semantics across different SQL
dialects, so sometimes it is necessary to help the parser to make the right
decision. This is the function of these options.

=over 4

=item * C<slash_terminates>

A Boolean option which causes, when set to a true value (which is the default),
a C</> (I<forward-slash>) on its own line, even without a preceding semicolon,
to be admitted as a (possible) terminator.

If set to false, a forward-slash on its own line is treated as a statement
terminator only if preceded by a semicolon or by a dot and a semicolon.

If you are dealing with Oracle's SQL, you should let this option set, since a
slash (alone, without a preceding semicolon) is often used as a terminator, as
it is permitted by SQL*Plus (on non-I<block> statements).

With SQL dialects other than Oracle, there is the (theoretical) possibility that
a slash on its own line can pass the additional checks and be considered a
terminator (while it shouldn't). This chance should be really tiny (it has never
been observed in real world code indeed). Though negligible, by setting this
option to false that risk can anyway be ruled out.

=back

=head2 C<split>

=over 4

=item * C<< $sql_splitter->split( $sql_string ) >>

=back

This is the method which actually splits the SQL code into its atomic
components.

It returns a list containing the atomic statements, in the same order they
appear in the original SQL code. The atomic statements are returned according to
the options explained above.

Note that, as mentioned above, an SQL string which terminates with a terminator
token (for example a semicolon), contains a trailing empty statement: this is
correct and it is treated accordingly (if C<keep_empty_statements> is set to a
true value):

    my $sql_splitter = SQL::SplitStatement->new(
        keep_empty_statements => 1
    );
    
    my @statements = $sql_splitter->split( 'SELECT 1;' );
    
    print 'The SQL code contains ' . Scalar(@statements) . ' statements.';
    # The SQL code contains 2 statements.

=head2 C<split_with_placeholders>

=over 4

=item * C<< $sql_splitter->split_with_placeholders( $sql_string ) >>

=back

It works exactly as the C<split> method explained above, except that it returns
also a list of integers, each of which is the number of the
I<unnamed placeholders> contained in the corresponding atomic statement.

More precisely, its return value is a list of two elements, the first of which
is a reference to the list of the atomic statements exactly as returned by the
C<split> method, while the second is a reference to the list of the number of
placeholders as explained above.

Here is an example:

    # 4 statements (valid SQLite SQL)
    my $sql_code = <<'SQL';
    CREATE TABLE state (id, name);
    INSERT INTO  state (id, name) VALUES (?, ?);
    CREATE TABLE city  (id, name, state_id);
    INSERT INTO  city  (id, name, state_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    SQL
    
    my $splitter = SQL::SplitStatement->new;
    
    my ( $statements, $placeholders )
        = $splitter->split_with_placeholders( $sql_code );
    
    # $placeholders now is: [0, 2, 0, 3]

where the returned C<$placeholders> list(ref) is to be read as follows: the
first statement contains 0 placeholders, the second 2, the third 0 and the
fourth 3.

The recognized placeholders are:

=over 4

=item *

I<question mark> placeholders, represented by the C<?> character;

=item *

I<dollar sign numbered> placeholders, represented by the
C<$1, $2, ..., $n> strings;

=item *

I<named parameters>, such as C<:foo>, C<:bar>, C<:baz> etc.

=item * C<< $sql_splitter->keep_comments( $boolean ) >>

=back

=head2 C<keep_empty_statements>

=over 4

=item * C<< $sql_splitter->keep_empty_statements >>

=item * C<< $sql_splitter->keep_empty_statements( $boolean ) >>

Getter/setter method for the C<keep_empty_statements> option explained above.

=back

=head2 C<slash_terminates>

=over 4

=item * C<< $sql_splitter->slash_terminates >>

=item * C<< $sql_splitter->slash_terminates( $boolean ) >>

Getter/setter method for the C<slash_terminates> option explained above.

=head1 SUPPORTED DBMSs

SQL::SplitStatement aims to cover the widest possible range of DBMSs, SQL
dialects and extensions (even proprietary), in a (nearly) fully transparent way
for the user.

Currently it has been tested mainly on SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle.

=head2 Procedural Extensions

Procedural code is by far the most complex to handle.

Currently any block of code which start with C<DECLARE>, C<CREATE> or C<CALL> is
correctly recognized, as well as I<anonymous> C<BEGIN ... END> blocks,
I<dollar quoted> blocks and blocks delimited by a C<DELIMITER>-defined
I<custom terminator>, therefore a wide range of procedural extensions should be
handled correctly. However, only PL/SQL, PL/PgSQL and MySQL code has been tested
so far.

If you need also other procedural languages to be recognized, please let me know
(possibly with some test cases).

Bound to be plenty, given the heuristic nature of this module (and its ambitious
goals). However, no limitations are currently known.

Please report any problematic test case.

=head2 Non-limitations

To be split correctly, the given input must, in general, be syntactically valid
SQL. For example, an unbalanced C<BEGIN> or a misspelled keyword could, under
certain circumstances, confuse the parser and make it trip over the next
statement terminator, thus returning non-split statements.
This should not be a problem though, as the original (invalid) SQL code would
have been unusable anyway (remember that this is NOT a validating parser!)

=head1 SHOWCASE

To test the capabilities of this module, you can run it
(or rather run L<sql-split>) on the files C<t/data/sakila-schema.sql> and
C<t/data/pagila-schema.sql> included in the distribution, which contain two
quite large and complex I<real world> sample db schemata, for MySQL and
PostgreSQL respectively.
