* Minor docs enhancements.

0.10000       2011-01-20 07:00:00 Europe/Rome

* Moose dropped in favour of Class::Accessor::Fast, since some people think
  Moose is an overkill for such a simple module.

* Command line SQL splitting utility sql-split added.

* Added GRANT support: thanks Alexander Sennhauser for the report.

* Added MySQL DELIMITER support; closes bug #60401: thanks ed.shrock.

* Private methods heavily refactored.

0.07000       2010-06-26 04:00:00 Europe/Rome # NEVER RELEASED TO CPAN!

* Much improved procedural blocks handling:
  - dollar quoted blocks handling;
  - better "CREATE ... FUNCTION|PROCEDURE" handling.

* Minimum required SQL::Tokenizer version is now 0.20
  (thanks Igor Sutton for this new version).

* End of deprecation cycle on the "keep_semicolon" option (has now been
  removed for good).
  
* Tests and docs additions.

0.05003_1     2010-06-21 08:30:00 Europe/Rome

* Fixed a bug which caused a PL/SQL package without the package name after
  the END to not be split correctly. Kindly reported by Dan Horne: thanks!

* Tests for this.

* Updated the LIMITATIONS section in the docs to explain that we cannot handle
  a PL/SQL PACKAGE block _with_ an initialization block inside, if the
  package lacks _both_ its name after the END and the trailing slash.

0.05003       2010-06-20 00:00:00 Europe/Rome

* A bit more robust "CREATE ... PACKAGE" handling, so that it is now
  accepted the use of the "PACKAGE" keyword as an identifier (even unquoted).

* Tests for that.

* Better explained LIMITATIONS.

* Minor doc fixes.

* Cleaned MANIFEST up from a perl stackdump.

0.05002       2010-06-17 08:00:00 Europe/Rome

* Now handles also the presence of a so-called "initialization block" inside a
  "PACKAGE" block (anyone who happen to be a PL/SQL user: my sincere
  condolences!)

* Tests for that.

0.05001       2010-06-17 06:00:00 Europe/Rome

* Now handles also the PL/SQL "CREATE ... PACKAGE" construct (thanks
  Dan Horne for his info about that!)

* Tests for that.

0.05000       2010-06-17 04:00:00 Europe/Rome

* Now handles transactions (starting either with "BEGIN" and "START")
  correclty.
  Closes bug #58032. Thanks Frew Schmidt.

* Now handles procedural code as well.
  Closes bug #57971. Thanks Dan Horne (thank you Dan also for the info by
  private mail!)

* Now handle also Oracle-style statement terminators (slash and
  semicolon-newline-slash-newline).

* Start of deprecation cycle on the "keep_semicolon" option which has been
  renamed to "keep_terminator" (as now different terminator tokens are
  recognized).

* Many tests and docs additions.

* Switch from Class::Accessor to Moose.

0.03000       2010-05-30 03:00:00 Europe/Rome # NEVER RELEASED TO CPAN!

* "split_with_placeholders" method added.

* Tests and docs for "split_with_placeholders".

* Assorted minor code and docs enhancements.

0.01002       2010-05-28 20:30:00 Europe/Rome

* Removed "use DBI" from some tests, which was left there for error (and caused
  said tests to fail, where DBI was not installed).

* Minor docs enhancements.

0.01001       2010-05-28 19:00:00 Europe/Rome

* Added the ability to discard/keep comments.
  Really, this is a change in the API, since now comments are discarded by
  default, while before they were returned instead.
  I hope that this won't harm any user, given the young age of this module
  (furthermore there isn't any difference when feeding the returned statements
  to a DBMS, the differences are just /cosmetic/).
  Sorry anyway!

* Added tests and docs for this.

0.01000       2010-05-27 08:00:00 Europe/Rome

* Initial release.
